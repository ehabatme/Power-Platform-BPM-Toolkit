### What is the BPM Toolkit ?  

BPM means "Business Process Management".


[BPM in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management).   
[BPM according to IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/automation-software/business-process-management). 

The goal was to provide a highly secured approval system that can be used in HR, supply chain management, finance in order to fix some shortcomings in the Power Platform like the 30 days approval limitation, no tasks delegation, no state machine, no graphical view of the running workflows,...

### License needed for using the Power Platform BPM Toolkit (SharePoint)

The end users only need a normal Office 365 license. 
IT needs a premium license for the deployment. 
If you create custom actions, you will need the Per flow license (500$/month for the whole company)
If you want a RPA interaction, you will need the Per Flow license + 1 RPA license

### Why do I need to use SharePoint ?

Because your end users don't have to pay a premium license to benefit from all features provided by the BPM Toolkit. 
We are working on a CDS/Dataverse version that will require a premium license.

yes, several multinational companies are using the BPM Toolkit for automating their HR business process. They are currently testing the tool.
